This repository demonstrates a common error in C++ when modifying a `std::vector` while iterating over it using an index-based for loop.  The example shows how removing an element from the vector shifts the elements, potentially causing out-of-bounds access or incorrect results. A solution using iterators is also provided, illustrating a safer and more efficient way to modify vectors during iteration.
